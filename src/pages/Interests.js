                    Data Analysis is nowadays gaining more importance as data enlarges to huge amounts. Nowadays it is easy to reach 
                    data in comparison to previous times but the problem is to reach more reliable data. Simultaneously, the
                    categorizing and provision of data to people are becoming more crucial. In the
                    fields, I studied and worked I often used data and analyzed them in a manner to reach a trustworthy
                    conclusion. In my master thesis which you can find on this website, I extracted the data related to automative
                    industries across the time series and applied them in economical methods to judge the competitiveness of the
                    automotive industry. Later I prepared a research proposal to evaluate the innovativeness of universities in
                    economical clusters with an intention to make doctoral research. This idea has remained sofar as an intention
                    but I am planning to develop it.
                    Thus while I was working in the bank, I utilized the commercial data of persons and entities who apply for a
                    loan. Now i am doing analyses partly as a hobby and putting them in&nbsp;

                    Briefly, I am close to data analysis and developing myself further in this area with I&T tools.

                    During both studies and work experiences, I participated in many projects that are needed to be treated from start to end with a holistic 
                    approach. Web Design can be perceived as a project that there are special processes till a web app is hosted in a server to be
                    requested from the computers of people all around the world.  
                    Before making it a tangible object that can reach people, you have to imagine in several aspects how it should
                    seem at the end. Most likely, you have to consider reactions of people. These reactions might affect your way of doing
                    in regards to your final purpose. At least possible, you can behave like an independent artist which does not mind the views of
                    others. As the process goes further, you can make some changes as you might not think anymore like before. Web -Design includes all
                    bittersweet times like the other creative processes. As an apprentice, my this view can be seen as exaggerated but it gives somehow
                    an excitement that maybe comparable with the one of an author after the publication of his or her book.
                    </p>
                    <p className="lead" style={{textAlign:"justify", textIndent: "3rem"}}>
                   
                    Web Design is not just the flow of codes in the background, but a free place in which you can make your creativeness speak out. 
                    I set up this site in this manner and it makes me excited whenever i update it. In the final version, i used for all pages the JavaScript 
                    library React that gives freedom to speak out the creativeness.

                    Although I am not a professional teacher, I experienced it somewhat while I was teaching Turkish to
                    foreigners. I believe that
                    first you have to be a good student to be a good teacher. I am overall interested in languages and learned
                    several languages that
                    are belonged to different language families. Since the early ages in high school, I have been taught in
                    English also in Science
                    and Math lessons. Furthermore, I studied in English for the bachelor’s (Istanbul University-Turkey) and
                    master’s degrees
                    (Friedrich Schiller Jena University-Germany) in Economics.

                    When I settled down in Germany, I learned German intensively. Before this, I got familiar to some degree with
                    German as it was
                    taught a second foreign language in high school. To be honest, I was not able to communicate in German at that
                    time. After all
                    years, I am comfortable now in German as I even read German literature in its original language. Maybe later.
                    I can write on this
                    site about the German books that I have read so far. Besides these, I learned Spanish and Japanese to the
                    degree that I am not
                    doing well in these languages. But I watch sometimes movies and documentaries in the subtitles of these
                    languages as a challenge.

                    So far I have not said anything about my mother language Turkish. Surely, I love the Turkish language because
                    it is my
                    “Heimatsprache” (Homeland-Language) as Germans say. I am still discovering special things in the Turkish
                    language while I am
                    teaching to foreigners. Contrary to other popular beliefs, Turkish belongs to Altaic languages group. But
                    there are still debates
                    on which language group it belongs to. Turkish differ from the languages I have been familiar with that it is
                    the most
                    mathematical language. If the essential rules are obeyed, the logic always succeeds in the Turkish language
                    since there are fewer
                    irregularities. For a further view of mine about the languages, you can read the&nbsp;

                    Definitely, I am not a creator now in this field excluding my early attempts. My interest in literature in this
                    sense has not been
                    beyond the reading books of the authors I like since my early ages. Nowadays. I am not reading a lot like I
                    was in school but I
                    still try to read with my kindle to be relieved of the stress in daily life. Those are mostly the literary
                    works that I could not
                    find a chance to read before but also personal developing books or magazines about I&T besides the online
                    resources. Thus, I can
                    come up with the idea to write blog alike essays on this site about the books I read.
