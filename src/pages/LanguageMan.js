        The languages (Turkish, English, and German) that I know are listed below and painted as organs on the body. 
        Each color and each organ has a personal meaning for the relevant language.

        My native language is Turkish and painted on the organs of ear, nose, mouth, and eye with the color red. The similarity of 
        the above organs is that they are all sense organs. Additionally, it also stands on the heart of the body. This explains 
        how important my native language is in my life. Without it, I would not be able to find the senses of life, such as hearing, 
        seeing, smelling and speaking, and also be able to express my feelings from the heart. In this regard, the red reflects human 
        characteristics such as liveliness, passion and anger, which are only fully grasped in the native language.

        <p className="lead" style={{textAlign:"justify", textIndent: "3rem"}}>
        The hands were painted blue to symbolize the world language English. English is the most spoken language in the world and 
        therefore it can be called a key to globalization. Blue is an appropriate color because the world consists mostly of water 
        in blue. I find the English language special because it was the first foreign language that I started to learn at the age of 
        12. Until end of master's studies, it played an important role as a language of education. Because of the international nature 
        of English, I was able to go abroad and speak to local people without knowing their language. In my first years in Germany, 
        I often spoke English. In this sense, English has helped me since my childhood to discover the world and to deepen my knowledge. The hands were chosen intentionally because they are the most used organs in the body and are available to us every moment as to how much English is spoken in the world. Therefore, English is characterized by easy accessibility, universality and presence.
